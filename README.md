# Novo

The **novo** language is a fast, portable, and secure domain-specific
programming language. It aims to be a subset of the
[Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/) templating engine with additional features,
but without HTML support. The main use case is for mathematical calculations.
Like Twig, it will allow a context to be passed as input, and the output of code
execution will be a modified context, not HTML.
